# Stock Trading Bot

This repository contains implementation of Reccurent Neural Networks using Keras and Tensorflow in order to make a stock trading bot. The inspiration for the project was SentDex's video about cryptocurrency trading bot using RNN which you can see [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/cryptocurrency-recurrent-neural-network-deep-learning-python-tensorflow-keras/).
